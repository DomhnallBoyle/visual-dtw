What's the plan?
I feel depressed
Call my family
I'm hot
I'm cold
I feel anxious
What time is it?
I don't want that
How am I doing?
I need the bathroom
I'm comfortable
I'm thirsty
It's too bright
I'm in pain
Move me
It's too noisy
Doctor
I'm hungry
Can I have a cough?
I am scared
My head hurts
My arm is sore
My leg is sore
My chest feels tight
My throat is dry
I have toothache
My ear is sore
My skin is itchy
My nose is runny
I'm tired
How much is that?
Can I have a bag?
Can you help me?
I would like a coffee
I would like tea
How are you?
I am feeling good
I feel great!
It's good to see you
Thank you
Let's go out
I need fresh air
Could you open the door?
I agree
I disagree
Please talk slower
Can you speak louder?
Can you speaker more quietly?
Can you put the light on?
I'm busy
I'm available
It's my birthday
That sounds good
I'm happy
I'm sad
I don't want to do that
I want to be alone
I need quiet
I need a rest
This week
Next week
This month
Next month
This year
Next year
This morning
This afternoon
This evening
It's important
It's urgent
Can you call
My mother
My father
My brother
My sister
My son
My daughter
My relative
Better than yesterday
Worse than yesterday
I'm fed up
This is boring
When will it end?
When is the next one?
I want a shower
I need headphones
Can you turn on the tv?
Can you pass my book?
Can we go outside?
Can I have a blanket?
How are you today?
Tell me about your day?
I want a haircut
Is it warm outside?
Is it cold outside?
Have you plans for the weekend?
I'm going on holiday
I feel lonely
This is the way
SRAVI is great!
